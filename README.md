the place where I sit, but then, suddenly, I’m not. I stand.

There’s a sensation that brushes at the back of the mind somewhere between having forgotten something and knowing that everything is running its proper course. Too much like this beach. The feeling of damp coolness as waves pull sand from beneath feet, mingled with the heavy breeze of midsummer over sweaty brow. The water calls to you from your soul’s necessity, but the mind holds you in place as it considers the right course. Somehow your body knows the path. Somehow your deeper mind knows it, too. Then, your mind stumbles on the correct answer by years of training, only to find the blur of imperfect language. The tip of your tongue tingles with anticipation as your mouth salivates with desire for the coolness of submersion.

I can’t help but wiggle my toes in the sand while waves brush their tops. I love the combination of rough and silky.

My hand blocking the sunlight is less than a hand’s height above the horizon. The sun mixes with the clouds already-- rose gold brushing the top of the sky while cheeks still sting from her touch and hours’ passage. I feel the eternity of sunset in my soul.

There are millions and millions of stars in our galaxy. So many of these have planets in multitude. Each that rotates has a sunset, moments or epochs in period. Each atmosphere, its own palette of diffraction. Each sun, its own spectra of emission. Each observer, its mechanism. Each mind, its processor. Each processor, its experience. Each experience, its context. And in each context, its origins.

My pain feels kindred. Rapture, witnessed. Alone on the beach, I stand together with the multitudes I contain.

The breeze slows to an occasional wisp in sweat laden hair while thirst knocks on the front door of my mind with steady, calloused rapping. I don’t see any solace near except the impotable sea ahead. I’m already down to my shorts. There’s no need to dip a toe in; I can already tell it’s warm enough for comfort. There’s nothing I recall having to do tonight. Tonight’s been set aside just for this occasion.

Enjoying my time.

The ladder is a lot harder to find than expected. With the green flash just behind, all is a cloudy purple haze of pillars as I bob up and down over the rocks underfoot.

I know that we’re here, right now. 

Slowly surging pulses of the lake’s heart keep me aware that time is passing. Then again, I look back on a moment just before now and I realize I have come to
