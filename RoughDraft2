// This is a new outline for The University which follows a vein similar to The Epic of Gilgamesh and The Hero's Journey. I feel inspired by the possible resonance of a story with the collective unconsious shared within humanity's ancestral mind.

# The University

## King Giru (Gil)

### Narrator remarks on the splendor of a civilized city in a frozen moment of time, similar to the remark on the city in Gilgamesh's opening.

### Scene jarringly cuts to Giru abusing his powers of time travel while wearing a ferocious dragon mask. Here, he is found taking pleasure in having sex with women all across the city as they are frozen in time. Carelessly, he conceives several children and refuses to take responsibility for all the immaculate conception cropping up around the city.

#### Within this scene, we first see the nature of Gil's power, and his abuse therein. He is king of Tokyo in the sense that he is the leader of the Yakuza at its most powerful point in the future. He was born of his father's affair with a dragon queen, a time travelling entity which has made its presence known throughout the history of Japan and several other cultures. She is Quetzecuatl, Cleopatra, and the Demiurge all in one. She found appeal in the animality and force of will his father demonstrated in cultivating the Yakuza to its primacy. What Gil makes possible as its inherited ruler-- kumichō (組長; boss)-- is a ruthless domination of every attempt to seize the power of the Yakuza. He serves as a mystical lord king of the Yakuza, clearly announcing his status without fear of retaliation.

### In a new scene, Giru plans to have a relaxing time at the hot springs nearby. He arrives and finds himself horny again already. He freezes time without much thought going into it, and gets up to climb the fence into the womens' area of the hot springs. His towel drops off as he grabs onto the top of the fence, prompting Nakisawato to interject, "Hey man, don't be such a pervert."

#### Giru is enormously surprised that Kidu is not frozen in time, falling to the ground and hitting his head on the rocks below. He quickly regains consciousness, startled and angry. Without warning, he grabs Kidu by the legs and flips him off his feet and onto the ground. They begin wrestling, evenly matched now that Giru is unable to freeze time and gain sudden advantages over Kidu. They exhaust themselves quickly, overcome by the heat of the hotspring and exertion as they collapse simultaneously, fainting from the heat. Gilgamesh awakens, laughing, only to hear Kidu laughing as well. It had been a long time since he felt a decent challenge, and it quickly earned his respect. 

#### Giru has an aspect of fire, represented in his dragon nature. He is 2/3 god.
#### Kidu has an aspect of water, represented by their first encounter in the hot springs.

##### Nakidusawato? Nikido? Kidu? / The Kid (Enkidu names) 
###### Consider a male form of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakisawame

#### Kidu demands that Giru explain how he froze time in the surrounding area, and submits to Giru's demands that he explain what's special about him too. He knows something odd was going on, and Kidu can't hide it. He explains that he was born with wisdom, birthed from a human mother in this very hot spring after the tears of a God fell to the Earth and impregnated a mortal, during his weeping lamentation of his Godly wife's death in childbirth.
##### Giru explains that his mother was a dragon, sedeuced by the power of his father's leadership and ferocity. Bragging in nonchalance, he tells him outright that his father was the head of a powerful gang and that Giru is now the leader of all the yakuza. Kidu isn't really impressed. This pisses Giru off a bit, so he invites him to the city to bask in the luxury of his empire.

### Kidu and Giru return to Tokyo and they party. Hard.

#### Giru really enjoys it, now that he has someone that truly knows his secret. Kidu enjoys the video games and music that Kidu introduces him to, especially punk and violent games. He loves wild anarchy. However, he quickly starts to realize how fake everything is. He longs for genuine entertainment and wants to leave the city.

#### Not wanting to lose the company of his new friend, Giru proposes that they go in search of the Oni some of his gang members truly believe they have seen. 
##### They discuss the matter briefly with some of the philosophical elders of the yakuza that tell fortunes of the I Ching, and advise in the Dao and Dharma. All of them acknowledge the existence of an evil force hidden from the modern masses, but warn against fighting it directly. Each suggests that the surest path to victory is establishing order, justice, and right action in the populace.
##### Giru casts this option away as being too slow, showing his impatience. Kidu plays devils advocate, saying that the people deserve faster justice, with the swift removal of the cancerous tumor before it has any chance of festering. 
##### However, after they leave the presence of the elders, he says to Giru that they shouldn't start the fight with Humubaba. He already knows that he's out there, as he can sense his essence present in the waters of the hot springs. He's always been terrified of the energy and knows that embarking on the quest will surely lead to death. 

### Enter: Humubaba (Humbaba) the Father of Kaiju, King of Oni
#### Humubaba dwells at the bottom of the ocean. (This differs from Gilgamesh, where he is in the forest.) He has the ability to psychically control followers of all sorts. He can animate any matter into living things. He spawns non-spatial, non-temporal psychic entities which can drive men insane, bring misfortune, and haunt in both sleep and waking. He takes the form of insect, crustaceon, shark, serpent, squid, urchin, and beholder, all in one. He sees all with his manifold eyes. He crawls with six legs. He can levitate in and above water with his control of matter. He can disrupt natural order to a degree that it creates earthquakes, tsunamis, floods, and typhoons. The thousands of stalks that hold his eyes are armored with excreted titanium, and grow fractally to cover great area and angles. The thousands of tentacles that writhe between eyestalks can grip and draw victims deep to the maelstromic, whirlpool maw of siphoning teeth at his core. In meeting his gaze, all are subsumed in the strength of his horrific illusions induced.

##### Giru and Kidu must attempt to kill him in a way that avoids his gaze. For this, they must fight in complete blindness. 
######(Note, his time stopping is really just slowing time down to an extremely slow rate while increasing his own speed. The gaze effect still applies, as the nature of the mind does not behave according to typical timescales.)
##### To achieve this, Giru and Kidu gather artifacts for demon slaying, ranging from ancient, to modern, to transdimensional gifts from the Gods (other time travelers). 
###### This activity attracts the attention of Giru's mother, Ninsun. She isn't pleased with their decision, as she knows the legitimate danger posed. However, knowing the stubbornness born into him, she blesses him a Heavenly Lance capable of piercing any material through and out of existence. She warns him not to pierce Earth itself too deeply, lest he burn in the firey grip of Hell's gravity, nor the heavens too far, lest he freeze in the solitude of nothingness. 
####### (DAMN, THAT'S A GOOD MYSTICAL WARNING!)
###### Further, she adopts Kidu, making them true brothers.

#### Silently sailing out to the fight, Kidu is tense. He admits honestly to Giru that he is terrified of opening the gates of madness and choosing intentionally to cross the threshold into the unknown. His wisdom will not serve him in the manufactured reality of his enemy, and there is genuine risk of losing his power that he thought would always be within him. He admits that a small part of him would rather die than live life in the shadow of knowing, unable to penetrate the veil of ignorance with a broken mind.

#### Steeling their resolve, Giru and Kidu shadow their eyes in the darkness of the opaque vacuum. They watch through images displayed on the inside of their lead-lined capsules, but find only pure darkness and solitude as the electricity suddenly cuts out with the deep rumble of an ocean earthquake. The Canvas of the Unseen is painted bright with the potential horror of their quarry's form. However, Giru sticks to the plan, freezing time and using artifacts and weapons to aim a powerful barrage of attack on Humubaba. (Shamash the Sun God grants a momentary light in darkness to aid in this process.)

##### During the fight, Giru is tricked into a brief peek by becoming convinced that Humubaba is dead. Instead, he is gripped in Hell for what seems like an eternity as time resumes normally for Kidu.
##### Humubaba rises out of the ocean, levitating in the air, as he summons oni from all across Japan toward a lightning-filled cyclone of Death, tearing apart the fabric of reality with the exertion of his power. 
##### In a moment of his hubris, assembling a show of power to finally show humanity the horror to come, he concentrates the gaze of several eyes upon Giru in an effort to inflict the greatest possible suffering of over nine thousand lifetimes of hell experienced in a second.
##### Seizing the second of opportunity, Kidu strikes Humubaba with a critical blow. This distracts Humubaba long enough for Kidu to teleport Giru a distance away using an artifact. This puts him in another blind spot and releases him from madness. 

##### We realize that Giru discovered his ability to speed up time in his own mind, effectively able to ignore the horrors of his experience by passing them by in a blur. 

##### Giru, released, freezes time and uses the Heavenly Lance to pierce Humubaba through his maw and out through the other side. This kills him, piercing his demon heart, as his thousands of eyes go dead and the oni begin to fade out of their material manifestations and back into undifferentiated spiritual energy.

##### In victory, Giru cuts of the thousands of eyestalks and tentacles from the core and takes it as a trophy. 
##### Stranded at sea, they swim for a time until they find an enormous shinto gate illuminated in the bright mists of full moon. They chop it to pieces to build a raft which is much easier to ride back to shore.

#### In returning to his empire, he realizes that the oni had sullied the minds of a great many of his followers. In their absence, there was a void to be filled with newfound purpose. Giru was ready to take on that mantle and take charge in a path of newfound justice. 

### Returning home, shortly after cleaning up, Giru is visited by Ishitaru (Ishtar). She reveals the full beauty of her form, attempting to entice him with promise of eternal passionate love and fulfillment in the union of their marriage. He refuses. She persists. Giru begins shouting as he loses his temper.

#### Barging in to help, embarassingly, Kidu sees her for what she is immediately: a seductive, manipulative Goddess.

#### Very upset now, she folds spacetime and brings a hulking beast of a bull from an alternate reality. It rushes to gore the two men, but they overcome it. 

#### Ishitaru is piiiiissed. Yelling.
#### Kidu gets pissed back, ripping off a limb of the beast and throwing it in her face. 
#### Ishitaru is beyond fucking pissed. She's straight up Kali-mode, ready to slay the ignorance of men in brutal reaping sweeps. She curses Kidu and he quickly becomes ill.

### Kidu suffers greatly from the illness.

### Kidu dies.

### Giru loses himself in grief.

### Giru realizes that he ages faster than the others around him, for having travelled through time so much more quickly during his escapades in frozen time. His mortality strikes him down hard.

### Giru wanders the countryside, meditating, visiting hot springs, and seeking peace in the solitude of the open countryside across the world, refraining from as much time manipulation as possible for fear of shortening his lifespan.

## Renewed in the Pursuit of Immortality

### He hears whispers and reads fragments which tell of a means to immortality. He goes out in search of the truth to that End. He remarks that the journey would have been so much easier with the wisdom of his brother at his side, weeping at his inadequacy for the task at hand. Yet still he persisted.

### He hears that there are mountains which guard the rising and setting Sun, so he goes to them and finds Antarctica.

#### Giru ventures beyond the mountains of the Inner Ring of the Antarctic mountains and finds an entirely new set of continents encircling the last. He is astonished at the scope of his discovery and begins to doubt a wide variety of assumptions he holds regarding the Universe.
##### He encounters some super strong scorpion men which guard the secret of the Outer Ring and overcomes them with difficulty.

#### Quickly, he becomes suspicious that he is inside yet another ring of mountains and seeks the farthest perimeter. Instead, he finds a wall of darkness at the edge of the Sun's transits.

#### Terrifyingly, he can enter it and come back to the Outer Ring just by turning around and walking back. He has no idea what lies ahead in the darkness, but he resolves to enter it none-the-less.

### Giru walks for ten leagues. 

### Giru meeds with Siduri, Goddess of Beer and Wisdom. She greets him and offers him a refreshingly cold beer as a reward for seeking deep within the unknown, unaided, for Truth. As part of his reward, she tells him how it is he can reach people that know of true immortality.

### He sets out to cross the lethal waters with the boatman Urshanabi, only to find him and immediately strike him in the head and starts wrecking his things.

#### Giru smashes some things of stone, unknowingly destroying tools necessary to cross the river of death.

#### Now, Giru must cut down trees to use as a means to cross the waters.

### Once across, Giru meets Utnapishtim. He is counseled against pursuit of immortality. Harshly. And then he challenges him.

### Utnapishtim challenges Giru to stay awake for 6 days and 7 nights.

#### Giru immediately fails, in exhaustion from his quest.

### Under compassionate recommendation from his wife, Utnapishtim concedes knowledge of a plant which renews youth. 

### Giru immediately seeks it out, striving hard to find it.

### Giru finds the plant at the bottom of the ocean.

### Giru brings it up and embarks on the jouney home.

### Nearly back, he bathes. During his bath, a serpent coils around the plant and vanishes away with it.
#### Perhaps another time traveller?!

### Deeply disappointed, he ventures back to his empire. Here, he returns to the mundanity of mortal life. However, he has a renewed vigor for right action.

### The story ends with Giru's description of the city's beauty at night. The way the light sparkles with activity at a distance, and people roam in enjoyment of freedom's release from the hard worked day behind them. He smiles at the part he plays in bringing freedom and enjoyment to so many, remarking that he has some changes of plan for the yakuza.
